# PyridineHydroxlation

This repository contains the code and spreadsheets related to the selection of pyridines/N-heterocycles that will be subject to biocatalytic hydroxylation with FDMOs in a collaboration between the Narayan and Sigman laboratories.

## Directory Structure

All code is store in the parent directory PyridineHydroxlation.

data/ contains the initial results from the eMolecules search. The search was done by submitting pyridine as a structure query and limiting results to molecules with molecular weights less than or equal to 300 g/mol

figures/ contains drawings of molecules that were removed from the intial search because of incompatible functional groups, violation of Lipinski's rules, and molecular weights less than or equal to 300 g/mol

frames/ unused directory

plots/ interactive html plots of the data projections used for training set selection

results/ intermediate spreadsheets that are generated after each filtering operation

## Missing Files

Files are missing from this repository because of file size. These include the code for PCA/UMAP projections.
